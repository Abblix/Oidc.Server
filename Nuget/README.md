# Abblix OIDC Server

**Abblix OIDC Server** is a robust .NET library that implements the OpenID Connect protocol on the server side. It is designed to meet high standards of flexibility, reusability, and reliability, using well-known software design patterns such as modular and hexagonal architectures. These patterns ensure that different parts of the library can work independently, improving the library's modularity, testability, and maintainability. The library also supports Dependency Injection using the standard .NET DI container, which aids in better organization and management of code. Specifically tailored for seamless integration with ASP.NET WebApi, Abblix OIDC Server employs standard controller classes, binding, and routing mechanisms to simplify the integration of OpenID Connect into your services.

## NuGet Packages Description

- **Abblix.OIDC.Server**
  This core package implements the OpenID Connect (OIDC) server functionality, providing a robust, compliant, and extensible framework for adding OIDC-based authentication and authorization to .NET applications. It supports various OIDC flows and configurations, tailored for modern application security needs.

- **Abblix.OIDC.Server.MVC**
  Tailored for ASP.NET MVC applications, this package extends the Abblix.OIDC.Server to integrate smoothly with the MVC framework. It simplifies the process of securing MVC applications with OIDC, handling the intricacies of user authentication, session management, and secure redirections.

- **Abblix.JWT**
  The Abblix.JWT package facilitates handling of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) within the .NET ecosystem. It builds on top of `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` to provide utilities for token validation, generation, and management, making it essential for securing web applications and services that rely on stateless authentication mechanisms.

- **Abblix.DependencyInjection**
  This package extends Microsoft's default dependency injection (DI) framework. It allows for more advanced scenarios such as overriding dependencies directly via type, instance, or factory, aliasing services, and more complex service compositions and decorations. It integrates seamlessly, enhancing flexibility and maintainability of DI configurations in .NET applications.

- **Abblix.Utils**
  A utility package that provides common functionalities needed across various parts of the Abblix OIDC server implementation. These include helpers for logging, data manipulation, and other cross-cutting concerns that are essential for the operation and maintenance of security-focused services.
