/// <summary>
/// Provides functionality to retrieve user information as JWT claims, supporting both simple and structured claim

    /// Asynchronously retrieves a set of user claims for a specified subject identifier, including both simple and
    /// structured claim values as requested by the client application. This method supports the OpenID Connect
    /// specification by allowing for the selective disclosure of user information, catering to the need for complex
    /// data structures within claims.

    /// The unique subject identifier (sub claim) of the user whose information is being requested.

    /// A task that resolves to a <see cref="JsonObject" />, encapsulating the user's claims where each entry consists of
    /// a claim name and its value. The value can be a simple scalar value (e.g., a string or number) or a structured
    /// object, allowing for complex data types to be represented. Returns null if no information is available for the
    /// given subject. The use of <see cref="JsonObject" /> facilitates the representation of hierarchical data within
    /// claims,
    /// supporting richer and more detailed user profiles.

    /// Implementers should ensure that the disclosure of user information complies with applicable privacy laws and
    /// the principles of data minimization. Sensitive or personal information must only be shared with explicit user
    /// consent and in a secure manner. In cases where the requested user or claims are not found, returning null or an
    /// empty <see cref="JsonObject" /> helps maintain privacy and security.
