/// <summary>
/// Encapsulates the details of a client secret used in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect authentication flows.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Client secrets are critical for the security of client applications, especially those that
/// authenticate in a server-side context. This record stores hashed versions of the secret
/// to enhance security by avoiding the storage of plain-text secrets.
/// </remarks>
public record ClientSecret
{
	/// <summary>
	/// The SHA-256 hash of the client secret. This property is used to securely store
	/// and verify the secret without needing to store the plain text value.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// The SHA-256 hash provides a secure way to handle client secrets, allowing
	/// for their verification during the authentication process without risking exposure.
	/// </remarks>
	public byte[]? Sha256Hash { get; init; }

	/// <summary>
	/// The SHA-512 hash of the client secret. This property offers an additional layer
	/// of security by using a stronger hashing algorithm compared to SHA-256.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// SHA-512 hashes are more resistant to brute-force attacks due to their larger size
	/// and complexity. This property is optional and can be used in systems requiring
	/// heightened security measures.
	/// </remarks>
	public byte[]? Sha512Hash { get; init; }

	/// <summary>
	/// The expiration date and time for the client secret. Secrets past this date are considered
	/// invalid and cannot be used for authentication.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Setting an expiration date for client secrets is a best practice that helps mitigate
	/// the risk of secret compromise over time. It encourages regular rotation of secrets
	/// to maintain the security integrity of client applications.
	/// </remarks>
