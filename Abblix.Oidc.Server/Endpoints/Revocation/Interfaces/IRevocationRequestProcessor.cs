namespace Abblix.Oidc.Server.Endpoints.Revocation.Interfaces;

/// <summary>
/// Represents the capability to handle token revocation requests.
/// The authorization server invalidates tokens immediately upon revocation, preventing their future use.
/// Depending on the server's policy, revoking a token may also affect related tokens and the underlying authorization grant.
/// If a refresh token is revoked and the server supports revocation of access tokens, associated access tokens should also be invalidated.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// For more details, refer to RFC 7009 Section 2.1: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7009#section-2.1
