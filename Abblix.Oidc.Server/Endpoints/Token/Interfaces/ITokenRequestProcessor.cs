namespace Abblix.Oidc.Server.Endpoints.Token.Interfaces;

/// <summary>
/// Processes incoming token requests from clients, ensuring they are valid and authorized before issuing
/// the appropriate token response. Depending on the request type and granted permissions, the response can include
/// various types of tokens such as Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens and ID Tokens.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This interface abstracts the core logic behind token issuance in compliance with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
/// standards. Implementations are responsible for validating the token request details, determining the types of tokens
/// to issue based on the request's scope and authorization, and generating a token response that conforms to
/// the protocol specifications. While the typical response includes an Access Token and, in the case of OpenID Connect,
/// an ID Token, the exact contents of the response may vary based on the request parameters and server policies.
/// </remarks>
