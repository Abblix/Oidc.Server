/// <summary>
/// The Authorization Server MUST validate the Token Request as follows:
///
/// - Authenticate the Client if it was issued Client Credentials or if it uses another Client Authentication method.
/// - Ensure the Authorization Code was issued to the authenticated Client.
/// - Verify that the Authorization Code is valid.
/// - If possible, verify that the Authorization Code has not been previously used.
/// - Ensure that the redirect_uri parameter value is identical to the redirect_uri parameter value
///		that was included in the initial Authorization Request.
///		If the redirect_uri parameter value is not present when there is only one registered redirect_uri value,
///		the Authorization Server MAY return an error (since the Client should have included the parameter)
///		or MAY proceed without an error (since OAuth 2.0 permits the parameter to be omitted in this case).
/// - Verify that the Authorization Code used was issued in response to an OpenID Connect Authentication Request
/// (so that an ID Token will be returned from the Token Endpoint).
